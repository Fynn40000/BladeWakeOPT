The data curves are generated via QBlade for a tip speed ratio = 7.0 (corresponding to approx. 12.1rpm and a wind speed of 11.4m/s).

Two datapoints are added to the original dataset for the NREL 5MW turbine:
r(m)    chord(m)    twist(Â°)
1.5    3.542    13.308
63.0    0.9    0.1

To loss corrections (e.g. Prandtl Tip Loss...) etc. are included in the calculations.

The Power coefficient calculated for this operation point is CP=0.522
The Thrust coefficient calculated for this operation point is CT=0.774
