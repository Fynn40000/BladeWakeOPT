IMPORTANT:
=> change in file "src/FLOWVLM_rotor.jl" within the FLOWVLM Repository (installed within julia packages folder) following codelines:



=> within function (line 2028):
function _calc_distributedloads_lookuptable(ccbrotor::OCCBRotor,
                                            ccbinflow::OCCBInflow,
                                            turbine_flag::Bool;
                                            hubtiploss_correction=hubtiploss_nocorrection)

=> line to change (line 2064 and 2065):
	# airfoil cl/cd
    	cl[i], cd[i] = occb_airfoil(ccbrotor.af[i], thetaeff)

	=> change to:
		# airfoil cl/cd
    		cl[i], cd[i] = occb_airfoil(ccbrotor.af[i], -1*swapsign*thetaeff)
    		cl[i] = -1*swapsign*cl[i] 



??? WHY ???
=> If the turbine_flag argument is set to true, FLOWUnsteady negates the twist angles.
   The old codeline uses the negated twist angles to get the cl and cd values via the ploars (lookuptable).
   It is necessary to perform the table lookup with the positive twist angle, since in most cases the airfoil profiles are not symmetric and 
   the airfoil polars are not symmetrical to the y-axis to get the true cl and cd values.
